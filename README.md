## Team assignment. Part 1

1.**Agree on the purpose of the web site**

Discuss the reasons for a theme park operator to have a web site, the people who might look at such a web site and the reasons that they would be looking at the web site.

2.**Research theme park web sites**

As a group, choose five different web sites of theme parks. Review the type of information that you find on the sites, and the structure that these sites have to help people find that information. Make a list of the aspects of the sites that you think are a good idea or that work well, and a list of the aspects of the sites that you don't think are so successful. This will give you some insights that you can use when designing your own web site. Keep a record of the discussion in a document.

3.**Agree on the content for the web site**

Agree within the group the theme for your theme park and the types of attractions that you will have for the different visitors that you expect to come to your theme park. Think of any other services that you will provide to visitors (for example food, access to money and medical help). Think of any other information that people looking at your web site will want to know before they come and visit your theme park. Keep a record of the discussion in a document.

4.**Agree on the structure of the web site**

Agree within your group the structure of your web site, with the aim of designing a web site with 3 pages. What information will appear on the main page, and what will appear on the other two pages. Think about how you might present the content, and whether you will have semantic parts such as asides or pop-up windows. Keep a record of the discussion in a document.

5.**Design the wireframes for the web site**

Produce a set of wireframes for the site, showing the concepts for both a wide screen and small screen. These can either be drawn by hand or produced using a tool such as PowerPoint or a graphics package such as Illustrator. Avoid painting or photo-editing software such as Paint or Photoshop as designs produced in this way are difficult to edit. Ensure that the designs are clear and easy to read.

**Review criteria**
 
Marks will be awarded for the following:

- Identification of purpose of web site to the appropriate stakeholders  

- Evidence and analysis of 5 theme park web sites  

- Identification of relevant and appropriate content for the web site  

- Identification of an appropriate structure for the pages for the content for this web site  

- Design of the wireframes as a clear model for the web site

## Team assignment. Part 2

1.**Markup wireframes with HTML**

Review the three wireframes that you produced for the large screen version of your web site from part 1 of the team project and make any changes that you think would improve them. Work through the wireframes and decide on the correct HTML to build those pages. Think carefully about the use of layout tags such as tables, and only use them where content is really a table. Make sure that all the parts of the pages have a semantic identity, either by using existing semantic tags or by defining "div" tags for the content. Attempt to use a range of the various formatting tags available to add richness and extra meaning to your content. Consider how different media can add to the way that your pages communicate information.

Mark up your wireframes with the HTML tags that you intend to use. Upload these marked-up wireframes in a .zip file into the ****Workspace: static web pages** that is located **in the end of week 10**  and generate a shareable URL. Consider how your HTML supports the use of your pages by users with disabilities.

2.**Code HTML pages**

Code the three pages in HTML and enter in some essential text content that you write yourself. Name the main/first page of your web site: index.html. Ensure that you use comments to help all the coders to understand the code.

Find some pictures and any other media that you consider appropriate and embed them into the pages using the correct HTML tags. Ensure that your code includes comments to help you work with the code and quickly relate it to the wireframes. It could be helpful to include comments to indicate who contributed chunks of the code so that you can ensure you can work together as a team.

3.**Upload the pages to the static web page system**

Upload in the .zip file your three pages within a tidy directory structure to the **Workspace: static web pages** that is located **in the end of week 10**. Update your shareable link and load the pages in a browser using the shareable URL.

4.**Validate the code in the pages**

Validate your code using the [W3C code validator](https://validator.w3.org/).

**Review criteria**

We are looking for a well constructed skeleton that reflects the design in the wireframes and for content that is relevant and appropriate.

Marks will be awarded for the following:

- Does the URL lead to the correct website? 
- Appropriate semantic tags used, both the predefined tags and the appropriate use of div block tags.  
- The range of different layout, formatting and media HTML tags used and their appropriate use (eg tables used as tables not for layout)  
- Rich comments  
- Accessibility, particularly in the use of the media tags.   Tidy directory structure

Review the three wireframes that you produced for the large screen version of your web site from part 1 of the team project and add to them to ensure that they have the appearance that you wish your site to have. Ensure that you have agreed the colours that will be applied to the elements. Agree the font family or specific font that you will use for different parts of your site, and the colours that should be used.

Work through the wireframes and decide on the correct CSS to build those pages, and add classes and identities to the pages. Mark up your wireframes accordingly. Upload a .zip file of these new marked-up versions of the wireframes into the Workspace: static web pages in week 10.

## Team assignment. Part 4

1.**Markup wireframes with Layout CSS**

Review the three wireframes that you produced for the large screen version of your web site from the part 3 of the team project and add to them to ensure that they have the layout that you wish your site to have. In particular identify the HTML elements' absolute and relative positions taking the element enclosing hierarchy in your web site. Use the various ways of measuring elements on web pages as appropriate. Additionally, identify the boxes that enclose the HTML elements in your web site and consider the box properties (padding borders etc) that you want to define.

Work through the wireframes and decide on the correct CSS to build those pages, and check the class and identity properties of the elements in the pages. Mark up your wireframes accordingly.
